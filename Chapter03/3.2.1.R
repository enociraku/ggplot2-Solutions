# 1. Scatterplot - geom_point
# 2. Linechart - geom_line (geom_path maybe)
# 3. Histogram - geom_histogram
# 4. Bar chart - geom_bar
# 5. Pie chart - geom_bar (+ coord_polar)





# 2.

# The two geoms are quite similar the difference is that in geom_polygon the start and end points are
# connected and the resulting figure formed is color-filled. In geom_path only the points are connected 
# in the order in which they occur.

# In geom_line the points are connected from left to right, while in geom_path the points are connected
# in the order in which they occur.





# 3.

# geom_smooth - geom_point, geom_line
# geom_boxplot and geom_violin - geom_point, geom_rect (or geom_tile), geom_area, geom_line
